        <h2>How Forms work</h2>
        <p>
            1. A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.<br><br>
            2. The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.<br><br>
            3. The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the information in a database.<br><br>
            4. The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.
